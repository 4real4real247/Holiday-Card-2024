/* INSTRUCTIONS 
Create a layout for this holiday card! Your card should look like this: 
https://assets.codepen.io/t-15440/itp-holiday-card.jpg

Responsive design is NOT required. Remember to review old CodePens if you've forgotten how to do anything!

1. Find the font "Mountains of Christmas" on Google Fonts. Assign this font to display on your site.

2. Set up a background on the body. 
Color: #f0f4f9
Image: https://assets.codepen.io/t-15440/itp-holiday-bkgd.jpg
The image should not repeat
Have the image centered on the page, and aligned to the top of the window.

HINT: Forgotten how to do this? See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background

BONUS: Investigate the background-size property and see if this will help manage the size of the image...

3. Style the H1 so that it displays the Mountains of Christmas font, font color #C60F0F, size of 3rem, text aligned center. Give it some margin or padding so that it's not on top of the pinecones or the images below.

4. Set your images to display with 4 rounded corners to make a circle. (Stuck? Google for "css circle")

Give each image a red (#C60F0F) border.

5. Use CSS Grid to set all three circles next to each other. Give them a little space in between.

6. You're done for today! Go celebrate!
